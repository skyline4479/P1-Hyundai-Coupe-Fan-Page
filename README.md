<p>The Hyundai Tiburon is a sport compact coupe produced by Hyundai since 1996. Enthusiasts sometimes refer to the Tiburon by the nickname 'Tib' or 'Tibby'. A very reliable car with stunning looks and fairly good performance overall, but ride a bit harsh over pot-holed roads.. Overall Rating: review by: great drive, looks good, good preformance and not hard on fuel, over all great fun.</p>
